This GitHub repository contains two Jupyter Notebook files, namely "1_smoothing_methods.ipynb" and "2_statistical_methods.ipynb," which cover essential time series concepts such as seasonality, trend, and seasonality decomposition. In these notebooks, the ExponentialSmoothing, SimpleExpSmoothing, ARIMA, and SARIMA models have been utilized for time series analysis.

## Notebooks Description

### 1. Smoothing Methods (1_smoothing_methods.ipynb)

This notebook introduces various smoothing techniques, including Exponential Smoothing and Simple Exponential Smoothing. It demonstrates how these methods can help in handling seasonality and trend components in time series data, leading to improved forecasting.

### 2. Statistical Methods (2_statistical_methods.ipynb)

In this notebook, statistical methods for time series analysis are discussed. The ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models are introduced, allowing users to make accurate predictions based on historical data, seasonality, and other relevant factors.

## Installation
